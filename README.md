# Aromatic_Cycle_Grouper
### The script is part of a bigger project which I helped developing. The complete project is published [elsewhere](https://github.com/marciniega/pdbmani/blob/master/read_mol2_tools.py).
The function is meant to work in conjunction with others, but this piece of the project is used to to:
- Get the atoms on each aromatic cycle
- Identify the aromatic cycles which are adjacent to each other
- Set the adjacent aromatic cycles into groups if any
- Print a list of these groups on the terminal
- Store the list on a text file
